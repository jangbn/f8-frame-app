# Privacy Policy

## Introduction

Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle and protect your data in our app. Our commitment is to ensure that your personal information remains private and secure.

## Data Collection

Our app does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data. All features and functionalities operate entirely on your device without any external communication. There are no network requests, and no data is sent to any servers or third-party services.

## Local Processing

All operations, including photo selection, editing, and saving, occur locally on your device. This ensures that your data remains within your control at all times.

## Permissions

Our app may request access to your photo library for the sole purpose of allowing you to select and edit images. This access is strictly limited to your chosen photos and is not used for any other purpose.

## Data Security

Since our app does not transmit any data over the internet, the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches is minimized. Your data stays on your device, under your control.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in this document, and we encourage you to review it periodically.
